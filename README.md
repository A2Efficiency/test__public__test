# Title-24-Complex-HVAC-Energy-Models
Public repository of downloadable CBECC model files supporting the **CBECC Complex HVAC Example Guide**, organized by example.

## About This Project
California's performance compliance pathway lets design teams trade energy across systems and take credit for how a building performs in practice, rather than meeting a prescriptive checklist. That flexibility depends on an accurate energy model: the model has to be built correctly, the design team needs to understand what was assumed on its behalf, and the finished building needs to match those assumptions. Mechanical systems are usually the hardest part to model correctly, and the area where errors are most common.

This repository contains working CBECC model files for eight complex HVAC configurations that are common in Title 24 projects and are often modeled incorrectly. Each configuration includes a model and documentation covering the mechanical system as designed, how it maps to the CBECC object hierarchy, and the inputs needed for compliance. Full guidance documentation, system diagrams, and the HVAC System Options Database are hosted externally (see below).

## Attribution
Developed by A2 Efficiency with support from Southern California Edison (SCE) and the California IOUs under CalBEM Working Group 3.

## Model and Software Version
For the initial release batch:
- **Version:** `v1.0`
- **CBECC version used:** `CBECC 2025.2.0.1 (1395)`

## Folder Structure
Each `Example-Guide.pdf` is that example's PDF write-up (actual filenames are per example, e.g. `Example 1 - MF Ventilation Options and Split Heat Pumps.pdf`). Examples 1, 5, and 8 group design variants under `v1.0/` (`1a`–`1e`, `5a`/`5b`, `8a`/`8b`); the others keep their model files directly in `v1.0/`.

## Download Instructions
1. Browse to `Models/`
2. Open the desired example folder (e.g., `EX02_MF_Central-VRF-HP`); it contains the example PDF and a `v1.0/` folder
3. Open `v1.0/` (for Examples 1, 5, and 8, then open the variant subfolder, e.g., `1a/`)
4. Download the model files directly

Or clone everything:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/A2Efficiency/Title-24-Complex-HVAC-Energy-Models.git
cd Title-24-Complex-HVAC-Energy-Models
```

## Versioning Policy
- Version format: `vMAJOR.MINOR`
- MAJOR: changes that affect structure or compatibility
- MINOR: corrections or incremental updates
- Historical versions remain available for traceability
- CBECC version used for each release is documented here and in `Models/index.csv`, not in the folder path
